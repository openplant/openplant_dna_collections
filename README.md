# OpenPlant DNA Collections

> DNA collections distributed by the openplant initiative

The [OpenPlant Initiative](https://www.openplant.org/) has worked for the creation and disponibilization of open DNA collections. These parts have been discribed in publicaitons by our researchers, and are freely available in our platforms. For more information and contact, see the main OpenPlant website and the relevant publications.

Here you can find the genbank files and metadata, and SBOL objects for the plasmids in different collections:
